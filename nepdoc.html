<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p id="p1"><span class="pn"><a href="#p1">[1]</a></span>
The Waifu TCG is an online trading card game (TCG).
The term &ldquo;waifu&rdquo; has its roots in Western weeaboo culture.
&ldquo;Waifu&rdquo; is frequently used to refer to a fictional character that the
speaker has romantic feelings for.
It is the English word &ldquo;wife&rdquo; transcribed to Japanese
<i>katakana</i>,
then that transcription is transcribed back to the Latin alphabet using
the Hepburn romanization.
The Waifu TCG itself has its roots in the Hyperdimension Neptunia
community on the Twitch livestreaming service (henceforth just
&ldquo;Twitch&rdquo;).
</p>
<p id="p2"><span class="pn"><a href="#p2">[2]</a></span>
In the Waifu TCG, players can collect individual cards of predefined
characters.
Players are given freedom to pursue their own goals.
The cards cannot be used for battling as one might otherwise expect from
a TCG.
<h2 id="cards">Cards</h2>
<p id="p3"><span class="pn"><a href="#p3">[3]</a></span>
The Waifu TCG is played by sending commands to an automated program on
the Twitch livestreaming service, a bot called NepNepBot.
</p>
<p id="p4"><span class="pn"><a href="#p4">[4]</a></span>
Players can acquire cards through a variety of means, to be
described in the command documentation.
Doing so usually requires points.
Points are periodically given by the bot or can be acquired through
various other means.
</p>
<aside>
<p>
Refer to the command documentation for those other means:
Use
<kbd>!help</kbd>
in any channel with the bot, or see below.
</p>
</aside>
<p id="p5"><span class="pn"><a href="#p5">[5]</a></span>
Every <em>card</em> has a card ID (short for identifier) that is used to
uniquely refer to a card.
Every <em>waifu</em> has an ID that is used to refer to a waifu.
A card is an individual copy, an <q>instance</q> of a waifu, so to speak.
A single character may have more than one card.
For example, waifu ID 1687 could refer to this card:
<div class="cardwrapper">
  <div class="card card-tcg card-mythical">
    <div class="card-body card-body-tcg">
      <img src="https://lowee.de/ayDfu6I.jpg" alt="Rem" title="Rem"
      class="card-image" width="195" height="250">
      <div class="id-holder rarity-mythical">1687</div>
      <div class="invisible-space-holder">&nbsp;</div>
      <div class="rarity-holder rarity-mythical">mythical</div>
      <div class="promotion-holder rarity-mythical">★</div>
    </div>
    <div class="card-footer text-center">Rem<br>Re:Zero<br>Card ID: 1007583<br>Tradeable<br>Created July 22nd 2019, 3:51:59 am</div>
  </div>
</div>
</p>
<p id="p6"><span class="pn"><a href="#p6">[6]</a></span>
As can be discerned from the example card, each card contains:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>an image of the character,</li>
  <li>the character's name (Rem),</li>
  <li>the series the character originates from (Re:Zero),</li>
  <li>the card's rarity (Mythical),</li>
  <li>the card's waifu ID (1687),</li>
  <li>the card's promotion level (one star, i.e. one promotion),</li>
  <li>the card's ID (1007583),</li>
  <li>the card's tradability status (it can be traded),</li>
  <li>the card's creation date and time (in local time).</li>
</ol>
<p id="p7"><span class="pn"><a href="#p7">[7]</a></span>
Each card has a <b>rarity</b>.
Rarities range from Common through God.
Each rarity has an associated value.
The value becomes relevant in a number of contexts;
see the command documentation for details.
<!--
Some rarities may have a drop limit.
The drop limit specifies how many times a card can exist at the same
time.
-->
There are also two rarities &ndash; Special and Promo &ndash; that have their
own meanings.
Special cards are unique in the entire game.
They are not normally obtainable, but may be available through raffles
and the like.
Promos are not normally obtainable, but also not unique;
they are usually available through redeem codes during events such as
the HDN Marathon or holidays.
Neither Special cards nor Promos take up space in your hand.
</p>

  <tr><td>Common</td><td>5</td><td>50</td><td>100</td><!-- <td>unlimited</td> --><td>192</td></tr>

  <tr><td>Special</td><td>0</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td><td>N/A</td></tr>
</table>
<p id="p8"><span class="pn"><a href="#p8">[8]</a></span>
Individual cards may have a higher rarity than their base rarity.
This is called <b>promotion</b>:
When two cards with the same ID and rarity are in your hand, they will
automatically be promoted to the next rarity;
Mythical cards require three cards to be promoted to God.
Taking a card with a Common base rarity to God rarity will thus require
8&nbsp;spaces in your hand.
Promotion does not affect the bounty value;
the bounty value is determined by the card's base rarity.
<!--
A promoted card contributes to the drop limit at all lower rarities,
e.g. a Legendary promoted to God counts for the drop limit at Legendary
(6&nbsp;others left at most), Mythical (3&nbsp;others left at most) and God
(0&nbsp;others left).
-->
Some cards cannot be promoted:
[7609][Mythical]&nbsp;Hatsune Miku Bridal Version from Vocaloid has been
confirmed, [7576][Mythical]&nbsp;Gehaburn is very likely not able to be
promoted.
The reasons for this phenomenon are unknown,
but it seems like a deliberate decision.
</p>
<p id="p9"><span class="pn"><a href="#p9">[9]</a></span>
If a card is promoted to the highest rarity (God),
the <kbd>!godimage</kbd> command allows changing the image for it in your hand,
see <a href="#p127">&para;&para;&nbsp;127&nbsp;et&nbsp;seqq.</a>
The earliest promoted God in existence gets a cosmetic benefit:
It receives a golden glow and card attributes;
its rarity will be shown as <span style="white-space:nowrap">α&thinsp;God</span> as well.
</p>
<p id="p10"><span class="pn"><a href="#p10">[10]</a></span>
Promotion causes a card to be removed and a new one to be generated in the
stead of the cards used to promote,
i.e. if cards 1000123 and 1001432 promote to a new card,
it will get a new card ID and the creation date will be set to the date of the
promotion.
This only affects card creation date and legacy status,
but is otherwise just a technicality.
</p>
<p id="p11"><span class="pn"><a href="#p11">[11]</a></span>
Removing a card from play is called <b>disenchanting</b>
or <b>de</b> for short.
This term is used for cards you have in a booster or in your hand.
<h2 id="hand">The hand</h2>
<p id="p12"><span class="pn"><a href="#p12">[12]</a></span>
Your hand consists of the cards you are currently holding and your
currently active bounties.
Players start with 7&nbsp;hand spaces, but more are acquired by spending
money on booster packs.
</p>
<p id="p13"><span class="pn"><a href="#p13">[13]</a></span>
Hands can be upgraded.
Upgrading your hand means adding one space to your hand, allowing you to
hold another card or place an additional bounty.
Normally, your hand grows with buying booster packs:
Every time your total spending on booster packs hits a certain
threshold, your hand is automatically upgraded.
</p>
<p id="p14"><span class="pn"><a href="#p14">[14]</a></span>
The spending required for hand upgrades starts at 2000&nbsp;points.
Starting with space&nbsp;24, the spending required is exactly
1,000,000&nbsp;points since the previous upgrade.

<h2 id="account">Your account</h2>
<p id="p15"><span class="pn"><a href="#p15">[15]</a></span>
Your account on the Waifu TCG is tied to your Twitch account,
but not your Twitch username.
It is safe to change your name on Twitch;
you will keep your waifus.
<i>If you are a streamer</i>,
notify the admins of your name change because that requires special handling on their end.
</p>
<!-- OBSOLETE (that was fast...)
<p id="p16"><span class="pn"><a href="#p16">[16]</a></span>
<strong>If you are inactive for 90&nbsp;days,
  your account will be wiped.</strong>

Activity constitutes executing any TCG bot command.
Even just checking your points balance will suffice to be considered active again
and reset the 90&nbsp;day counter.
If your account is wiped, the cards of regular rarity (Common through God)
are removed from play <em>without filling bounties</em>;
cards of irregular rarity (Special and Promo) are preserved.
Should you know that you will be gone for an extended amount of time,
you can apply to staff on Discord for an exemption.
</p>
-->
<h1 id="commands">Commands</h1>
<p id="p17"><span class="pn"><a href="#p17">[17]</a></span>
This section describes the commands available for use with NepNepBot.
Commands can be used by either sending them as a whisper to NepNepBot or
by sending them to a Twitch channel where NepNepBot resides.
</p>
<p id="p18"><span class="pn"><a href="#p18">[18]</a></span>
An &ldquo;argument&rdquo; or &ldquo;parameter&rdquo; is a second word to be sent to the bot.
Here is an example command: <kbd>!search Mythra</kbd>.
!search is the command itself, and Mythra is the first argument to the
command.
</p>
<p id="p19"><span class="pn"><a href="#p19">[19]</a></span>
All commands that take an ID will normally work with waifu IDs.
If a waifu ID is ambiguous (because you have more than one of it in your
hand),
you will have to specify the <i>card ID</i> instead.
</p>
<h2 id="informational-commands">Informational commands</h2>
<p id="p20"><span class="pn"><a href="#p20">[20]</a></span>
Some commands are used to obtain information about about cards.
Informational commands are affected by a timeout, limiting how often you
can use them.
If too many of these commands are invoked within a certain timeframe,
further informational commands cannot be used until the timeout reset.
The timeout reset is global for all users.
It seems that the timeout reset occurs every 30&nbsp;or 60&nbsp;minutes.
It is unknown how many commands are needed to trigger the timeout.
</p>
<p id="p21"><span class="pn"><a href="#p21">[21]</a></span>
A much more generous timeout is applied for commands:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>in whispers,</li>
  <li>in the NepNepBot channel,</li>
  <li>if the Twitch streamer uses the commands in his or her own channel.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="!search">Finding a card by character (!search)</h2>
<p id="p22"><span class="pn"><a href="#p22">[22]</a></span>
<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!search <i>character name</i> [from <i>series</i>]</kbd>
</p>
<p id="p23"><span class="pn"><a href="#p23">[23]</a></span>
The !search command can be used to find a card for a certain character.
Either &ldquo;!search <i>character name</i>&rdquo;
or &ldquo;!search <i>character name</i> from <i>series</i>&rdquo;
can be used.
Character name and series are searched for partial matches, so that
&ldquo;gahar&rdquo; will find &ldquo;Hitagi Senjougahara&rdquo;.
There is no way to force a search for an exact match;
add the series name if needed.
Character names and series may contain diacritics (e.g. Pokémon).
However, searching for &ldquo;Pokemon&rdquo; will find Pokémon.
</p>
<p id="p24"><span class="pn"><a href="#p24">[24]</a></span>
To find more information about a particular card, use !lookup with the
ID you get from !search.
</p>
<h2 id="!lookup">Finding a card by waifu ID (!lookup)</h2>
<p id="p25"><span class="pn"><a href="#p25">[25]</a></span>
<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!lookup <i>waifuID</i></kbd>
</p>
<p id="p26"><span class="pn"><a href="#p26">[26]</a></span>
The !lookup command can be used to find a card for a certain waifu ID.
If you only know a name, use !search instead.
This command shows the following information about the card:
</p>
<ol>

</p>
<p id="p28"><span class="pn"><a href="#p28">[28]</a></span>
!checkhand is used to check your own hand.
It takes an optional argument.
If no argument is given, NepNepBot will send you a link to a website
that displays your hand.
If an argument is given and it is the text &ldquo;verbose&rdquo;, NepNepBot will
instead send the entire hand as a whisper.
In order for NepNepBot to be able to whisper to you, you must follow
NepNepBot on Twitch.

<p id="p30"><span class="pn"><a href="#p30">[30]</a></span>
!points is used to check the amount of points and the total amount of
pudding you have.
Points are given by the bot periodically, through redeem codes,
disenchanting cards or through bets.
Pudding are given as rewards for bets and set claims; see below.
This command is not affected by the timeout on informational commands.

<h2 id="acquiring-cards">Acquiring cards</h2>
<p id="p33"><span class="pn"><a href="#p33">[33]</a></span>
Cards can be acquired in various ways.
This section describes the commands used to acquire cards.
</p>
<h2 id="!freebie">Daily freebie (!freebie, !freewaifu)</h2>
<p id="p34"><span class="pn"><a href="#p34">[34]</a></span>
<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!freebie</kbd>
</p>
<p id="p35"><span class="pn"><a href="#p35">[35]</a></span>
Every 22&nbsp;hours, a single free card, a free booster pack or free
points can be obtained with !freebie.
Cards are directly added to the hand.
Boosters are opened immediately.
The rewards are fixed over a 30-day period, but their order is
randomized during those 30&nbsp;days.
The order is such that a &ldquo;good&rdquo; reward &ndash; as determined by the TCG
administration &ndash; cannot be immediately followed by another &ldquo;good&rdquo;
reward.
However, since the rewards are subject to change at any time, a full
list of the rewards is not listed here.
What <em>is</em> known about the rewards is that:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>there will be no guaranteed card of Mythical rarity or above;</li>
  <li>points can be combined with any other reward;</li>
  <li> the rarity of individual cards is predetermined, meaning that the only randomness is
    <em>what</em> card of that rarity you get.</li>
</ol>
<p id="p36"><span class="pn"><a href="#p36">[36]</a></span>
If you have no hand space and get a free card,
the free card is instead put into a newly created, fake booster pack.
This requires no hand space, but you must not currently have a booster
pack opened.
Due to technical reasons regarding the way !freebie fake booster packs
work, they cannot be sent to !freepacks.
</p>
<p id="p37"><span class="pn"><a href="#p37">[37]</a></span>
If you have no booster space and get a free booster pack,
the free booster is instead sent to the !freepacks system.

After buying a pack, NepNepBot will give you a link where you can select
which cards to keep and which cards to disenchant.
If you get a Legendary or higher, it is considered good practice not to
disenchant a card you don't want.
Instead, check if anybody owns the card already;
you may want to give it to them if they wish to promote.
You can &ndash; in addition or alternatively &ndash; give
#focused-trading on the Waifu&nbsp;TCG Discord server a heads
up that you are planning to disenchant the card and a timeframe when you
will disenchant it.
<aside>
<p>
You can get a link to the Discord server by using
<kbd>!nepcord</kbd>
in any NepNepBot channel.
</p>
</aside>
<p id="p43"><span class="pn"><a href="#p43">[43]</a></span>
Make sure to mention
<b>@TCG Player</b>
when giving a heads up.
This allows players to set bounties.
You should give at least a couple of hours, but around 12&ndash;24 hours
would be ideal.
</p>
<p id="p44"><span class="pn"><a href="#p44">[44]</a></span>
<b>Standard</b>
and
<b>jumbo</b>
packs are the same except for the number of cards in each pack.
Scam packs are heavily weighed towards cards with Common rarity, with
Uncommon rarity happening occasionally;
prefer using !buy Common, which costs only 25&nbsp;points instead of
100&nbsp;points.
The odds on a
<b>scam</b>
pack are such that if it gives you a Rare card,
you would have gotten a Mythical from a standard pack.
Certain packs above standard and jumbo may guarantee at least one card
of a certain rarity.
Packs mainly change the weighing of odds for certain rarity thresholds.
They may also guarantee a certain minimum card rarity.
</p>
<p id="p45"><span class="pn"><a href="#p45">[45]</a></span>
Opened booster packs expire after 28&nbsp;days.
If booster pack expires, the cards will be transferred to your hand
automatically;
the rest will be disenchanted.
If there are more cards in the booster pack than there is space in your
hand, only as many as can fit in your hand will be transferred, with
cards of higher rarity being prioritized.
If multiple cards have the same rarity, the resulting order amongst them
is unpredictable.
</p>
<p id="p46"><span class="pn"><a href="#p46">[46]</a></span>
There are a number of special packs.
The
<b>meme</b>
booster is added automatically into the !freepacks system if you buy a
jumbo booster that ends up having a disenchant value of exactly
625&nbsp;points
or (during the anniversary 2019 event:)
an anniversary booster of exactly 4000&nbsp;points
before bounties.
The
<b>supermeme</b>
booster
is given if you buy a standard booster and it disenchants for
exactly 420&nbsp;points or if you buy a jumbo booster and it disenchants for
exactly 100&nbsp;points (contains only Common cards);
the odds of a supermeme being awarded are 1/30,000.
It contains 100&nbsp;cards at the odds of a super booster.
A 420&nbsp;points jumbo pack does not entitle to any reward; neither does an
all-Common or a 625&nbsp;point standard pack;
the odds of a meme being awarded are around 1/1000.
</p>
<p id="p47"><span class="pn"><a href="#p47">[47]</a></span>
The
<b>holiday</b>
booster is a variant of the super booster that has slightly better odds
and contained one more card.
It was available during the holiday weeks of 2017 and is again available
December&nbsp;1, 2018 to January&nbsp;14, 2019.
The Christmas versions had Ultra rarity during the event of 2017;
they were changed to what is now called Promo after the event.
It uses so-called event weightings, which makes it drop the
Christmas/Winter versions of some cards more frequently.
They guarantee four Rare cards; no card is below Uncommon.
The
<b>jumbholiday</b>
booster is a holiday booster that just costs five times as much and
contains five times as many cards as a regular holiday booster.
</p>
<p id="p48"><span class="pn"><a href="#p48">[48]</a></span>
Similarly,
the
<b>jumbultimate</b>
booster was a variant of the ultimate booster, available during May
2018.
It contained 20&nbsp;cards at ultimate odds.
Since it was available only for a limited time, it is slightly more
cost-efficient than the equivalent amount of ultimate boosters:
Buying a jumbultimate saved 1333&nbsp;points over buying the equivalent
amount in actual ultimate boosters.
Megaultimates can be used to a similar effect now,
though without cost savings.
The
<b>halfmeme</b>
booster was a variant of the standard booster, available during late June
and early-mid July 2018.
It contained 50&nbsp;cards at standard/jumbo booster odds.
Since it was available only for a limited time, it was slightly more
cost-efficient than the equivalent amount of ultimate boosters:
Buying a halfmeme saved 83&nbsp;points over buying the equivalent
amount in actual standard/jumbo boosters.
</p>
<p id="p48a" class="dead"><span class="pn"><a href="#p48a">[48a]</a></span>
During the anniversary event, the
<b>anniversary</b>
booster is a booster pack with 7&nbsp;cards with odds that are comparable to
those of a premium booster but with bias towards Legendaries in particular,
costing 4000&nbsp;points.
They have a highly boosted chance for event tokens.
</p>
<p id="p49"><span class="pn"><a href="#p49">[49]</a></span>
Furthermore, there is the
<b>freeultra</b>
booster that contains exactly 1&nbsp;Ultra card.
Similar packs exist for other high rarities.
Those are used only internally, for example for raffles and such.
</p>
<p id="p50"><span class="pn"><a href="#p50">[50]</a></span>
The
<b>blazeit</b>
and
<b>jumblazeit</b>
boosters have the same odds as the scam pack.
These boosters were removed shortly after its introduction.
</p>
<p id="p51"><span class="pn"><a href="#p51">[51]</a></span>
All packs except jumbo can be prefixed with &ldquo;mega&rdquo;,
e.g. &ldquo;megaultimate&rdquo;.
This buys five of the same pack and puts them in one large booster at
five&nbsp;times the cost.
For a megaultimate, that would make 20 cards for 25,000&nbsp;points in one
booster.
Because this is implemented as opening five of the same pack,
your chances of getting a free meme or supermeme pack are the same as if
you were buying five jumbos/standards separately.
<h3 id="free-packs">Free booster packs</h3>
<p id="p52"><span class="pn"><a href="#p52">[52]</a></span>
A system for free booster packs exists.
Free packs do not expire.
Even though they are free, they behave like normal packs of their kind.
In particular, a free pack contributes to pity like a bought pack.
Free packs can be obtained from:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>winning one of the big prizes in a bet;</li>
  <li>opening a pack with a special disenchant value as noted above;</li>
  <li>through a bot administrator, usually by winning some sort of contest ran on the Waifu&nbsp;TCG Discord server.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="!freepacks">Showing free packs (!freepacks)</h3>

<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!freepacks</kbd>

<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!freepacks open <i>booster</i></kbd>
</p>
<p id="p56"><span class="pn"><a href="#p56">[56]</a></span>
This command opens the given <i>booster</i>.
This ends up working effectively like !booster buy <i>booster</i>
but no points are subtracted from your account.
<h2 id="bounties">Bounties</h2>
<p id="p57"><span class="pn"><a href="#p57">[57]</a></span>
Bounties allow you to acquire cards you want.
If the card with the given waifu ID is disenchanted,
it will instead be given to the highest bounty bidder.
Placing a bounty takes up a space in your hand until it is filled or
cancelled.
If your bounty is outbid, a whisper will be sent.
Because the whisper system is notoriously unreliable, you should not
rely on the whisper notification.
For the purpose of bounties, promoted cards are reverted to their base
rarity;
use the <kbd>!trade</kbd> command to move a promoted card to another player
instead.
<b>
Automating bounties, be it through bots or any other means, is
prohibited.
</b>
</p>
<p id="p58"><span class="pn"><a href="#p58">[58]</a></span>
The maximum value (&ldquo;rarity cap&rdquo;) is an arbitrary, usually relatively
large multiple of the rarity value of the card; see the rarity table
above.
It is possible to push the bounty past the rarity cap in order to outbid
someone else already bidding the rarity cap.
</p>
<p id="p59"><span class="pn"><a href="#p59">[59]</a></span>
Bounties cause new cards to be created;
they do <em>not</em> preserve any attributes of the card other than the
&ldquo;original owner&rdquo; attribute.
In particular, this means that using bounties can cause cards to lose their
legacy and first-god statuses.
</p>
<p id="p60"><span class="pn"><a href="#p60">[60]</a></span>
When a bounty is filled, the player disenchanting the card gets a bonus
in points for filling the bounty.
For the purpose of calculating that bonus, the minimum bounty value of the
card is taken at its base rarity, ignoring its promotions.
If the bounty exceeds the rarity cap,
the bonus is a quarter of the difference between the bounty and rarity
cap,
plus half of the difference between the rarity cap and the minimum
bounty value.
If the bounts is below or matches exactly the rarity cap,
the bonus is either 2&nbsp;points or half of the difference between the
bounty and the base value, whichever value is larger.
All divisions are rounded down to the nearest integer if needed.
</p>

!trade is used to facilitate trading of cards between players,
optionally including a points transfer.
Trade offers are valid for 24&nbsp;hours.
A Promo card can only be traded for another Promo card.
If trading cards of differing rarities, the owner of the card of lower
rarity has to cover the price difference of the cards' rarities;
the points go to the owner of the card with the higher rarity.
The minimum price to pay is 50% of the difference of the values between

<h2 id="pudding">Pudding, the secondary currency</h2>
<p id="p83"><span class="pn"><a href="#p83">[83]</a></span>
Other than points, there is a secondary currency called &ldquo;pudding&rdquo;.
Pudding can be used to buy booster packs;
1&nbsp;pudding has the purchase power of 25&nbsp;points.
However, pudding cannot be used for bountying cards.
Unlike points, pudding expire after two months.
Expiry happens on the eighth day of every month.
Users with expiring pudding will be notified via whispers.
This secondary currency is used as a reward for bets and set claims,
both described further below.
</p>
<aside>
<p>
This may seem oddly specific to you.
The truth is that bet rewards used to be booster packs, which was
considered too rigid for scaling the rewards.
Furthermore, a lot of sets were claimed very fast for the purpose of
making a profit, which was seen as undesirable.
A secondary currency just happened to be the most efficient way to
resolve both of these problems.
Sets don't exist anymore, so the only justification are historical
reasons now.

This command is used to buy the given <i>amount</i> of pudding using
points,
at a rate of 25&nbsp;points for 1&nbsp;pudding.
Pudding bought this way will expire like any other kind of pudding.
This command is meant to be used to buy a small amount of pudding if you are

</p>
<p id="p93"><span class="pn"><a href="#p93">[93]</a></span>
Points transfers are available to move points between users.
A points transfer consists of two stages:
setup and confirmation.
To set up a trade, use the <kbd>!sendpoints</kbd> command followed by the
user to transfer to, the amount of points and the reason.
In a second step, you will be prompted by the bot to use
<kbd>!sendpoints confirm</kbd> with a confirmation code to ensure
that you really wish to transfer the points.
</p>
<p id="p94"><span class="pn"><a href="#p94">[94]</a></span>
<strong>Every transfer requires a reason</strong>;
the reason can and should consist of more than one word.
This restriction is there to prevent abuse of this feature.
<strong>You will be charged the full amount of points as &ldquo;tax&rdquo;</strong>
in addition to the actual amount transferred:
So if you want to transfer 50,000&nbsp;points,
you must enter <kbd>50000</kbd> as the <i>amount</i>,
but pay 100,000&nbsp;points:
50,000&nbsp;go to the recipient, 50,000&nbsp;are kept as tax.
Points transfers that have not been confirmed will expire after an unknown
amount of time, measured internally in minutes.
If 1000&nbsp;points or more are successfully transferred,
the recipient receives a whisper about the transaction.

This command buys a certain reward.
If <kbd>special</kbd> is specified, you buy a Special card;
the details are to be filled in with the <kbd>!tokenshop special</kbd> commands.
If <kbd>handupgrade</kbd> is specified, you buy a hand space upgrade,
increasing your total hand spaces by 1;
this upgrade does not reset your progress towards your next regular hand space

<h2 id="betting">Betting</h2>
<p id="p96"><span class="pn"><a href="#p96">[96]</a></span>
The bet system allows streamers to host betting contests for their
speedruns.
Betting yields a reward in pudding.
Entering does not require any kind of entry fee;
there is no drawback to placing a bet.
The time used to check bets against is the time between !bet start and
!bet end,
<em>not</em>
what the timer on the screen says.
This means that an actually accurate guess may be wrong by up to several
seconds.
Bets with less than five&nbsp;participants will not be paid out;
streamers will be warned about this, but may override it.
The betting system is highly regulated.
The full rules can be found on the Nepcord in the #rules channel.
They may change without announcement;
check them frequently.
</p>
<p id="p97"><span class="pn"><a href="#p97">[97]</a></span>
The final bet result may be changed by the bot administrators if it is
off by more than 4&nbsp;seconds from the time shown on the stream.
</p>
<p id="p98"><span class="pn"><a href="#p98">[98]</a></span>
There are two kinds of
<b>big prizes</b>:
Being accurate to 10&nbsp;ms guarantees a special kind of booster pack;
being accurate to 1&nbsp;s guarantees a free Mythical card,
not counting towards pity.
The 10&nbsp;ms and 1&nbsp;s prizes can only be obtained if the final bet time is
at least 30&nbsp;minutes.
Calculating payout in pudding is relatively complex;
the summarized version is that relatively accurate guesses are generally
rewarded,
but being off by more than double the run time of the bet is punished
with halving the payout.
</p>
<aside>
<p>
It is currently unknown what this special kind of booster pack is.
For historical reasons of how the bet system used to work in early-mid
2018, it is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;tier&nbsp;7&rdquo; reward.
</p>
</aside>
<p id="p99"><span class="pn"><a href="#p99">[99]</a></span>
<b>
You can skip the rest of this section unless you really need to
calculate bet results yourself.
</b>
The calculation works as follows:
First, the minimum and maximum prizes are determined.
Two values are first taken from the database,
<i>betMinPrize</i> and <i>betMaxPrize</i>.
The values are misnomers as they do not actually reflect the true
minimum and maximum prizes.
<i>betMinPrize</i> is 10.
<i>betMaxPrize</i> is 20.
betMaxPrize is then multiplied by the number of betting players (the
entries) divided by 10, plus one; if this multiplier is more than 2
(i.e. if more than ten players entered the bet), it is set to 2 instead.
Then the amount of pudding is the sum of the minimum prize plus the
difference between the maximum and the minimum prize multiplied by the
the inverse place (entries - placement);
this is then divided by the number of entries minus one;
an additional division by&nbsp;1.4 occurs for everybody in the &ldquo;losing&rdquo;
half of the bet.
The puding for the first place are multiplied by&nbsp;1.3.
Everybody's results are then multiplied by&nbsp;1.5 if the bet takes place in
the HDNMarathon channel <em>and</em> the marathon boost is applied.
An additional multiplier of&nbsp;1.5 is applied if the bet has run at least
30&nbsp;minutes and the bet is accurate to the run time of the bet in
milliseconds divided by&nbsp;120;
this is roughly equivalent to being accurate to 15&nbsp;seconds per hour.
After these modifiers, the payout is halved for guesses that are off by
more than double the run time of the bet.
<!--
For example, take a bet that ran 3&nbsp;h, 5&nbsp;min, 10&nbsp;s and 0&nbsp;ms (\(*Dt)
and a bet B of 3:12:42.666 coming in third (p) out of 17&nbsp;bets (E) to
calculate the pudding (P).
The bet was not in the HDNMarathon channel and is not highly accurate,
so the multipliers (M) is going to be 1.
The bet was in the <i>lower</i> half, so the penalty (P) is 1.4.

The broadcaster is paid in pudding:
The points awarded is scaled to the run length.
For every hour of the run, the broadcaster is awarded 30&nbsp;pudding.
This is mathematically rounded to the next pudding.
The payout is capped twofold:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>A broadcaster cannot get more than 3000&nbsp;pudding per channel per
  calendar month,
  the equivalent of 100&nbsp;paid-out hours.</li>
  <li>A broadcaster cannot get more than 720&nbsp;pudding per bet,
  the equivalent of a run spanning 24&nbsp;hours.
  If a run goes on for more than 24&nbsp;hours,
  only the 720&nbsp;pudding paid out count towards the monthly pudding cap.</li>
</ol>
<aside>
<p>
The calendar month depends on the server time zone.
The server time zone is normally in CET (UTC+1);
adjust for daylight savings in <em>Germany</em>.
A bet that starts before the next calendar month
but ends after the start of the next calendar month
still counts towards last month's cap.

The time to bet on is given in hours, minutes and seconds.
Milliseconds are optional.
Specifying the hour field is required, even if you guess a time with 0
hours;
in this case, you would have to use e.g. 0:42:09.69.
Often, streamers will give a time estimate.
They are not required to.
If no estimate is given, try going through their old videos for some
previous times.
It is possible to overflow the minute and second fields, so that 0:00:69

A set can only be claimed by one person.
Like bets, set rewards are paid in the secondary currency &ndash; pudding.
Claiming a set will yield the associated pudding reward.
The pudding reward will regularly be much less than the combined values
of the cards;
it is thus generally only worth going after a set if you find yourself
pursuing many of the cards for yourself or if you happen to get a lucky
booster getting you close to one.
There is a <b>cooldown of one&nbsp;week between claims</b> for the same set.

<h3 id="!upgrade">Hand upgrade (!upgrade)</h3>
<p id="p124"><span class="pn"><a href="#p124">[124]</a></span>
<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!upgrade [buy]</kbd>
</p>
<p id="p125"><span class="pn"><a href="#p125">[125]</a></span>
!upgrade has two functions.
If used with no arguments, it will show you how much a forced hand
upgrade costs;
even though this is an informational command, it is not subject to the
timeout on informational commands.
Additionally, if there has been any mistake calculating your hand spaces,
any invocation of !upgrade will fix it.
</p>
<p id="p126"><span class="pn"><a href="#p126">[126]</a></span>
If used with the argument &ldquo;buy&rdquo;, it will upgrade your hand in exchange
for 50% of the spending required to normally reach the next hand space
threshold.
Buying a hand upgrade increases your spending as if you had actually
bought the equivalent value of boosters.

<h3 id="!de">Disenchanting a card (!disenchant)</h3>
<p id="p127"><span class="pn"><a href="#p127">[127]</a></span>
<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!disenchant <i>ID</i> [<i>ID</i> ...]</kbd>
<br>
or
<br>
<kbd>!de <i>ID</i> [<i>ID</i> ...]</kbd>
</p>
<p id="p128"><span class="pn"><a href="#p128">[128]</a></span>
!disenchant disenchants cards.
If you have multiple of the same card, this command will disenchant only
as many cards as specified; that is, &ldquo;!de 1984&rdquo; disenchants one of 1984,
even if there are multiple in your hand.
When disenchanting a card of Mythical rarity or above, or a promoted card, a
confirmation prompt will be shown.
The same applies to Promo and Special cards.
There is normally no reason to disenchante a Promo or Special card;
no points will be awarded and no hand space is gained.
The community will likely loathe you for disenchanting a Special card.
</p>
<p id="p129"><span class="pn"><a href="#p129">[129]</a></span>
Multiple cards can be disenchanted in one go by adding each of their card IDs
or waifu IDs as a separate argument.
If a confirmation is required for one card, it must be added to the
very end of the list.
</p>
<p id="p130"><span class="pn"><a href="#p130">[130]</a></span>
For example, if you have only one card for a given waifu
(e.g. waifu ID&nbsp;1984), &ldquo;!de 1984&rdquo; will disenchant that.
If you instead have 2&nbsp;cards of the same ID, you will have to specify the <i>card ID</i>
(e.g. card ID&nbsp;1012123) like so: &ldquo;!de 1012123&rdquo;.

to suggest fixes to a card.
Please study the rules on the form before suggesting a fix.
</p>
<p id="p137"><span class="pn"><a href="#p137">[137]</a></span>
Issues that warrant a fix include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>wrong name or series (missing accents, inconsistent wrong name ordering
  in the same series),</li>
  <li>image issues (image is of wrong character, exceedingly low quality,
  broken link, subtitles in image).</li>

This command just gets the reply &ldquo;No.&rdquo; from the bot.
!giveme used to instead yield &ldquo;Sorry, you are not an admin.&rdquo;
Originally, the command dropped a card of the requested rarity.
It was used to test the drop/rarity algorithm.

<h3 id="!sorthand">Sorting your hand (!sorthand)</h3>
<p id="p140"><span class="pn"><a href="#p140">[140]</a></span>
<b>Synopsis</b>:&nbsp;<kbd>!sorthand <i>ID</i> <i>sortnum</i></kbd>
</p>
<p id="p141"><span class="pn"><a href="#p141">[141]</a></span>
This command allows reordering cards in your hand.
Cards are normally sorted first by waifu ID, then by rarity, then by card ID,
each in ascending order.
The <kbd>!sorthand</kbd> command allows adding a factor that is considered
before the IDs, the sort number.
Cards are sorted in ascending order according to the sort number first,
i.e. lowest is listed first.
Sort numbers can be in the range of -32768 to 32767.
Cards that have no sort number explicitly set will have a sort number of 32000,
and the waifu IDs and rarity card IDs act as tie breakers in that case.
(It's probably easier to actually fiddle around with it to understand how it works.)
</p>
<h3 id="!sorthand-reset">Resetting your hand sorting (!sorthand reset)</h3>

<h2 id="profiles">Profiles</h2>

</p>
<p id="p145"><span class="pn"><a href="#p145">[145]</a></span>
Badges can be obtained either through redeem codes or through special

Because badges are not part of your hand, they take no hand space.
The alternate reality game (ARG) is one of the major sources of badges.
The following badges are known; the set badges are not listed for

<h2 id="godimages">Images for promoted god cards</h2>
<p id="p150"><span class="pn"><a href="#p150">[150]</a></span>
As noted previously, cards can be promoted.
If a card is promoted to God rarity,
it is possible to request an image change.
The request is cancelled if the card is disenchanted or traded while the
request is still pending.
Image requests are not possible for cards whose base rarity is God as

<p id="p153"><span class="pn"><a href="#p153">[153]</a></span>
The following
<b>
base requirements
</b>
must be followed when issuing a request:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>The card must be eligible for an image change.
  This excludes base God cards and the Saimoe cards (waifu IDs&nbsp;2008&ndash;2018).</li>
  <li> The image depicts the correct character.
  Alternate forms of a character are okay if no card for it currently
  exists.
  For example, that means Black Sister is not allowed as a godimage for
  Uni because she exists as card [76];
  however, as a counterexample, illayaya was granted Arfoire's DOS form as
  a godimage on [100].</li>
  <li>The image may not contain two or more characters.</li>
  <li>The image must have at least reasonable quality.
    <!-- OBSOLETE
  Most likely, the quality requirements are more stringent for global
  requests.
    -->
  </li>
  <li>The image may not be too much of a meme.
  It is unknown what the limits of that are.</li>
  <li>Regarding how explicit a card may be, mild nudity appears to be okay.</li>
  <li>Animated gifs are okay as long as they follow the rules outlined above.</li>
  <li>The request must be in line with the Twitch content policy.
  In particular, this means that porn or overly sexually suggestive
  images, gore and illegal content are not permitted.
  <strong>
  Requesting a card that violates these guidelines will likely get you
  banned.
  </strong>
  The bot tells admins: &ldquo;If it is porn/illegal/etc, just ban the user.&rdquo;
  It is thus strongly recommended you manually talk to an admin before you
  put in the request if you are even just the slightest bit unsure if it
  is acceptable.
  Do not believe that the administrators will assume your request is in
  good faith.</li>
  <li>The aspect ratio of the image may not exceed 16:9 in either direction,
  i.e. 9 over 16 &lt;= width over height &lt;= 16/9.</li>
  <li>The image's file size must not exceed 2&nbsp;MiB (2,097,152&nbsp;bytes).</li>
  <li>The image <b>must be hosted on imgur</b>.
  Other image hosts will not work.</li>
  <li>If you have changed the godimage before,
    your last (accepted) change request for the same card was
    more than 30&nbsp;days ago.
    This is counted starting from <em>the time of request</em>,
    not the time the request was accepted.</li>
</ul>
<aside>
<p>
Use the cards promoted to God in the hands of users Flutter and
KisaraShera as a reference point for nudity.

Individual image changes affect <em>only</em> that particular card.
Trading the card with a changed image will retain the changed image.
An individual image change is requested with !godimage request.

<p id="p155"><span class="pn"><a href="#p155">[155]</a></span>
Global image changes affect
<em>all</em>
copies of that card.
The change affects the waifu herself, rather than the card.

<p id="p156"><span class="pn"><a href="#p156">[156]</a></span>

However, global image changes are generally only granted if the picture
is suitable as a change for the card itself;
in particular, this is likely the case if the replacement is of
obviously greater quality than the current image.
A request for a global change may be downgraded to an individual change
if it is deemed unsuitable as a global change.
The inverse is not true:
A request for an individual change cannot be upgraded to a global
change.

Only streamers who have the bot in their channel can use these alerts
for their streams.
Most mainstream streaming software, such as the Open Broadcaster

<p id="p182b"><span class="pn"><a href="#p182b">[182b]</a></span>
Event tokens are acquired by opening packs.
Every pack has a chance to contain anniversary tokens.
The chance is approximately 20% of a token per pack.
However, <b>anniversary</b> packs have a vastly higher chance to contain
tokens than regular packs.
If a pack contains a token, it is shown in the booster,
but immediately transferred to your account;
there is thus no danger of accidentally getting rid of an event token.
Packs may be trashed normally to no adverse effect with regards to event tokens.
</p>
<p id="p182c"><span class="pn"><a href="#p182c">[182c]</a></span>
Opening anniversary packs contributes to a pack tracker.
As certain amounts of anniversary packs are opened by the community,
certain rewards are given to the community as a whole.
It is unknown what those rewards are unless the conditions are met.
</p>
<p id="p182d"><span class="pn"><a href="#p182d">[182d]</a></span>
Event tokens show up in your hand, but take no hand space.
They cannot be disenchanted.
Similarly, they are not transferable or tradeable.
</p>
</div> <!-- class=dead TODO move past 182e -->
<p id="p182e"><span class="pn"><a href="#p182e">[182e]</a></span>
The following rewards in exchange for tokens are available:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Item</th><th>Token Cost</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Previous Promo</td><td>10+</td><td>Cost starts at 10&nbsp;tokens and then doubles for every Promo bought; maximum five&nbsp;Promos per person</td></tr>

<h1 id="communism">Points distribution</h1>
<p id="p183"><span class="pn"><a href="#p183">[183]</a></span>
NepNepBot regularly distributes some amount of points to people who are
in a channel with it.
No chatting is actually required to get passive points.
The points gain seems to be 5&nbsp;points every 5&nbsp;minutes.
If sitting in a channel that is currently streaming on Twitch <em>and</em>
having sent at least one line in chat, the points gain may increase up
to 15&nbsp;points per 5&nbsp;minutes plus the multiplier on that value.
The multiplier value appears to be 1.0.
The 15&nbsp;points decrease by 1 until the base 5&nbsp;points for every
5&nbsp;minutes of inactivity.
NepNepBot commands count as activity.
Users whose names contains &ldquo;bot&rdquo; anywhere cannot get an activity
bonus.
</p>
<p id="p184"><span class="pn"><a href="#p184">[184]</a></span>
<b>
Using bots to profit from this mechanic automatically is not permitted.
</b>
However, it is possible to permanently idle in a channel and gain the
regular amount of points.
This amounts to 1440&nbsp;points per day or 43,200 points per 30&nbsp;days.
<h1 id="irregular-rarities">Cards of irregular rarity</h1>
<p id="p185"><span class="pn"><a href="#p185">[185]</a></span>
There are two kinds of cards of &ldquo;irregular&rdquo; rarity:
Promo and Special.
Of those, Promo cards are most commonly released to the entire
playerbase,
whereas Special cards are generally reserved for individual players or
very small groups.
Neither of them take up any space in your hand.
<h2 id="promos">Promo cards</h2>
<p id="p186"><span class="pn"><a href="#p186">[186]</a></span>
Promo cards are usually obtainable under various special conditions.
It is only possible to trade a Promo card for another Promo card.
The first type are <b>event Promos</b>:
They are available for the duration of a specific event through redeem
codes.
This happened during the second HDNMarathon, for example.
</p>
<p id="p187"><span class="pn"><a href="#p187">[187]</a></span>
Then there are <b>time-limited Promos</b>:
These are cards that enter the game as regular cards and can be pulled
normally.
Time-limited Promos normally have a rarity of Legendary.
Currently, the &ldquo;Summer Edition&rdquo; cards are one such case;
they will leave after August 31.
A special case of these are the so-called &ldquo;chans&rdquo;.
They're cards that are personifications of things, such as
[6496]&nbsp;Earth-Chan or [7585]&nbsp;Discord.
A chan turns Promo two weeks after its introduction.
</p>
<p id="p188"><span class="pn"><a href="#p188">[188]</a></span>
Finally, there are <b>weighted time-limited Promos</b>:
These are cards that enter the game as regular cards and can be pulled
normally,
but they also have increased weighting, i.e. are more likely to be
pulled.
This happened for the Valentine's Day event.
<h2 id="specials">Special cards</h2>
<p id="p189"><span class="pn"><a href="#p189">[189]</a></span>
A few players have cards of Special rarity.
These cards are unique.
</p>
<p id="p190"><span class="pn"><a href="#p190">[190]</a></span>
They used to be given out to cornerstones of the community.
Those are marked as &ldquo;special thanks&rdquo;.
However, &ldquo;special thanks&rdquo; Special cards no longer occur.
Similarly, high amounts of dedication to a franchise could sometimes
yield a Special card.
However, requirements have spiked lately:
Only truly extraordinary achievements &ndash; such as amassing
one&nbsp;million&nbsp;points &ndash; still award a Special card these days.
Some cards were given out as reference to some in-joke;
those are marked with &ldquo;(meme)&rdquo;.
</p>
<p id="p191"><span class="pn"><a href="#p191">[191]</a></span>
Anyone can get a Special card by sending a postcard to Marenthyu or
meeting up with him.
Sending a postcard allows the sender to pick a custom name and image,
but the series will be locked to &ldquo;Postcard Collector&rdquo;.
Meeting up with Marenthyu will yield a &ldquo;The Truth&rdquo; card.
<h1 id="pulling-algorithm">Pulling algorithm</h1>
<p id="p192"><span class="pn"><a href="#p192">[192]</a></span>
This section outlines the algorithm that guards what cards are pulled
from the deck when opening a booster pack.
<h2 id="pulling-algorithm-concepts">Core concepts</h2>
<p id="p193"><span class="pn"><a href="#p193">[193]</a></span>
There are two random number generators (RNGs) involved.
One is the &ldquo;Python&rdquo; random number generator (Python RNG);
I call it that because it's the random number generator that is used in
the Python programming language, which the bot is written in.
The Python RNG is a Mersenne Twister.
The other is the &ldquo;MySQL&rdquo; random number generator (MySQL RNG) or just
&ldquo;RAND()&rdquo;;
I call it that because it's the random number generator that is used in
the MySQL database, which is the software used for the database where
the bot stores its data.
Both will be used in different ways.
</p>
<p id="p194"><span class="pn"><a href="#p194">[194]</a></span>
Every pack has a list of &ldquo;upgrade chances&rdquo;.
These are the literal odds that a rarity is upgraded to the next one.
<b>
These chances differ for every pack.
</b>
The upgrade chances are normally increased by the pity system.
However, packs that are neither listed in <kbd>!booster list</kbd> nor able to be
bought do not contribute to pity and do not use pity-boosted odds;
one such booster pack type would be the meme pack.
For example, an <b>imaginary</b>
test booster pack may have the following odds:
1, 1, 0.5, 0.5, 0.25, 0.1, 0.01.
This means a Common is guaranteed to be upgraded to an Uncommon (1),
an Uncommon is guaranteed to be upgraded to a Rare (1),
a Rare has a 50% chance of being upgraded to a Super (0.5),
a Super has a 50% chance of being upgraded to an Ultra (0.5),
an Ultra has a 25% chance of being upgraded to a Legendary (0.25),
a Legendary has a 10% chance of being upgraded to a Mythical (0.1),
a Mythical has a 1% chance of being upgraded to a Mythical (0.01).
The likelihood to reach an Ultra exactly is thus 0.1875.
<!--

<h2 id="pulling-algorithm-cards">Pulling the cards</h2>
<p id="p195"><span class="pn"><a href="#p195">[195]</a></span>
Before anything else,
the maximum number of event tokens (like anniversary tokens) in a pack
is taken.
For each possible event token,
the Python RNG is rolled for the chance of a token.
Every token obtained reduces the number of actual cards in the pack.
</p>
<p id="p196"><span class="pn"><a href="#p196">[196]</a></span>
After this, the actual cards are pulled.
The first step is always to perturb the state of the Python RNG (it is
&ldquo;reseeded&rdquo;) using data from the underlying operating system on the
server it runs on;
this makes it infeasible to manipulate the Python RNG effectively.
In a second step, the rarity is determined:
For every rarity until God, a number is rolled;
if the number is less than the upgrade chance, the rarity is upgraded.
However, if the rarity determined contains no droppable waifus &ndash; as
occasionally happens with cards of God rarity &ndash;,
the rarity is silently downgraded by one.
After this, the Python RNG is reseeded again.
The card that is pulled <em>within</em> the rarity is determined by the MySQL
RNG,
which also uses the card weighting.
The list of cards that the MySQL RNG can pulled is limited in three ways:
</p>
<ol>
  <!-- <li>cards at drop limit cannot be pulled,</li> -->
  <li>players cannot pull cards that they themselves own at God rarity, and</li>
  <li>a card that has already been pulled in the current pack cannot be pulled
  again.</li>
</ol>
<p id="p197"><span class="pn"><a href="#p197">[197]</a></span>
Finally, the pity data is updated for all rarities that are above the
card's rarity.
Note how
<b>pity is updated after every card</b>,
which means that it is possible to cross the pity threshold in the
middle of a pack.
Because the packs are not pulled in waifu ID order, it is impossible to tell
how many cards were pulled before a pity pull.
<h2 id="pulling-algorithm-pity">Pity</h2>
<p id="p198"><span class="pn"><a href="#p198">[198]</a></span>
Pity values increase the odds of a certain rarity dropping.
After crossing a certain amount of pity value,
pulling a card of the respective rarity is guaranteed.
Each pity value is increased by the number of cost per card.
This means that in a pack that costs 5000&nbsp;points and contains 3&nbsp;cards,
the affected pity values would be updated with
5000/3&nbsp;=&nbsp;1666.666&hellip;
The number of cards is the effective number of cards;
meaning that the number of cards for the purpose of calculating the cost
per card is reduced by the number of tokens:
Had the example pack with 3&nbsp;cards contained an event token,
it would instead be updated with (per card)
5000/2&nbsp;=&nbsp;2500.
</p>
<p id="p199"><span class="pn"><a href="#p199">[199]</a></span>
The pity thresholds are as follows:
<table>
  <tr><th>Rarity</th><th>Threshold</th></tr>
  <tr><td>Super</td><td>2000 points</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Ultra</td><td>10,000 points</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Legendary</td><td>25,000 points</td></tr>
  <tr><td>Mythical</td><td>100,000 points</td></tr>
  <tr><td>God</td><td>(does not exist)</td></tr>
</table>
<h2 id="pulling-algorithm-weighting">Weighting</h2>
<p id="p200"><span class="pn"><a href="#p200">[200]</a></span>
In addition to pity aiding individual players reach each rarity,
there's a weighting system that is meant to ensure that every card is
pulled eventually.
Every 24&nbsp;hours, the weighting of a card goes up slightly,
making it more likely to be pulled.
When a card is pulled, the weighting is reset.
Weighting for cards of Super rarity and above is boosted.
If a card of Super rarity and above drops twice in one&nbsp;day,
it gets an additional penalty to prevent it from dropping again for two
days.

<p class="note">
These sections are now irrelevant because they concerned time-limited
events.
However, for the sake of accuracy and historical preservation,
these sections got moved here.
</p>
<h2 id="anniversary-2018">The 2018 anniversary event</h2>
<p id="p208"><span class="pn"><a href="#p208">[208]</a></span>
During all of August 2018, there was an anniversary event.
While the event lasts,
periodic point gain was increased by a factor of&nbsp;1.2 and
any pack can contain so-called event tokens.
Event tokens were non-transferrable and have no points value.
One event token would take the place of one card in a booster pack;
the token was added to your account immediately after opening the pack
and cannot be trashed.
There was no guarantee that any booster pack would actually contain an
event token.
Event tokens could be exchanged during 48&nbsp;hours after the anniversary
event ends; rewards were:
</p>
<ol>
  <li>one gacha roll for one&nbsp;token;</li>
  <li>one copy of a single, pre-existing Promo card at the cost of</li>
  three&nbsp;tokens (full list available at: <a
   href="https://pastebin.com/ciz3BxVx">https://pastebin.com/ciz3BxVx</a>);</li>
  <li>one custom Special card at the cost of six&nbsp;tokens; only one Special
  card per player;</li>
  <li>one additional hand space at the cost of ten&nbsp;tokens; only one
  additional hand space per player.</li>
</ol>
<p id="p209"><span class="pn"><a href="#p209">[209]</a></span>
The gacha rewards were divided into five tiers.
First, the tier is picked.
After that, a reward is picked from the tier.
When rolling the gacha with !tokengacha,
you could thus get:
</p>
<table>
  <tr><th>Tier</th><th>Possible Rewards</th></tr>
  <tr><td>1</td><td>super booster pack, 40 pudding, 800 points</td></tr>
  <tr><td>2</td><td>halfmeme booster pack, 80 pudding, 1600 points, freeultra</td></tr>
  <tr><td>3</td><td>premium booster pack, 120 pudding, 2400 points</td></tr>
  <tr><td>4</td><td>ultimate booster pack, 200 pudding, 4000 points, freelegendary</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5</td><td>(unknown)</td></tr>
</table>
<p id="p210"><span class="pn"><a href="#p210">[210]</a></span>
Moreover, there were anniversary booster packs.
They cost 4000&nbsp;points, contain seven&nbsp;cards and only contained cards
of Rare rarity or above.
They have a higher chance of containing event tokens as well as HDN
Marathon Victory cards.
A &ldquo;zfresh&rdquo; card was obtainable only from anniversary packs.
<b>
The &ldquo;zfresh&rdquo; card must not be traded or otherwise transferred &ndash;
even just temporarily.
If it is transferred, the card will be taken away.
